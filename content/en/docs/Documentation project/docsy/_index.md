description: A quick overview of what makes Docsy useful

Docsy is a Hugo theme for documentation developed by a Googler and is used on many large projects including [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) & [gRPC](https://www.grpc.io/) to name a few.

Hugo websites are static generated, meaning the hosting platform need only serve plain HTML/CSS/JS/Asset blobs, while a CI/CD pipeline triggers on changes to the content repository. Content can be written in multiple formats but primarily Markdown, which is a simplified markup language for writing web content.

- [CommonMark - Markdown Reference](https://commonmark.org/help/) covers the basic Markdown syntax
- [Markdown Guide - Extended Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/) covers more capabilities, including tables, syntax highlighting & footnotes.

The theme is flexible and  fully customizable, requiring only knowledge of Hugo and basic web development skills. Hugo itself is based on Go lang and directly uses Go's templating language and module system, making it familiar to anyone with Go experience.
