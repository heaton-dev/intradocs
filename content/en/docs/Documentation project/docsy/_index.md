Docsy is a Hugo theme for documentation developed by a Googler and used on many large projects including [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) & [gRPC](https://www.grpc.io/) to name a few.

Hugo websites are static generated, meaning the hosting platform need serve plain HTML/CSS/JS/Blobs files, while a Continuous Delivery pipeline regenerates on Git merges and pushes out updates.

The theme is flexible and  fully customizable, requiring only knowledge of Hugo and basic web development skills. Hugo itself is based on Go lang and directly uses Go's templating language and module system, making it familiar to anyone with Go experience.

Content is authoried in Markdown, with support for tables, and allows for HTML inline. Docsy also packages Hugo Shortcodes which can make more complex functionality available, it's also possible to augment the Markdown renderer with Hooks.
